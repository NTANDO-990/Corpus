    Section B
    6.	Definition:
A marriage in community of property means that both spouses share a joint estate.
 All assets and debts accumulated before and during the marriage become jointly owned unless specifically excluded 
 (e.g., inheritances with conditions).
	7.	Advantages:

	‚Ä¢	Simpler estate planning and administration
	‚Ä¢	Both spouses benefit equally from assets acquired
Disadvantages:
	‚Ä¢	One spouse‚Äôs debt affects both
	‚Ä¢	Limited financial independence

	8.	Purpose of ANC:
An antenuptial contract allows spouses to exclude the community of property and profit/loss regime. It also gives the option to include or exclude the accrual system, providing financial independence during¬†the¬†marriage.

Section C
Answer:
Yes, the creditors can attach Lerato‚Äôs car. Since Sipho and Lerato did not sign an antenuptial contract, they are married in community of property. All assets (including Lerato‚Äôs car) form part of the joint estate and are thus vulnerable to claims by Sipho‚Äôs creditors.
	10.	Answer:

	‚Ä¢	Tshepo‚Äôs accrual: R1,000,000 ‚Äì R500,000 = R500,000
	‚Ä¢	Anna‚Äôs accrual: R2,000,000 ‚Äì R0 = R2,000,000
	‚Ä¢	Difference in accrual: R2,000,000 ‚Äì R500,000 = R1,500,000
	‚Ä¢	Tshepo is entitled to half the difference:¬†R750,000
